Cool let's begin then

demo_test.txt contains the following
&lt;h2&gt;jQuery and AJAX is FUN!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p1"&gt;This is some text in a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

<https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_ajax_load>
open up this link

<@U8B6NRYES> will be taking AJAX

Yeah..okay
Thanks <@U8B1RPPEW>

So Lets start

How many of you here? Put a :thumbsup:

<@U8BS39J1L> has joined the channel

Yea so AJAX 
Why do we need AJAX, what are its benefits?
Any ideas?

update the part of webpage without reloading it.

okay..
AJAX can selectively modify a part of a page displayed by the browser, and update it without the need to reload the whole document with all images, menus, etc...

Yea correct

till now whatever we saw the data was by default set by us, yes?

<@U8BSWMSLE> has joined the channel

But you cannot keep so much data in your webpage... it will be a pain to write so many html files or so.

Imagine facebook writing your profile page for 2 billion users :stuck_out_tongue:

So that's where AJAX calls come into picture...we load the data from our server and display them on your webpage

We are into front-end part, so do not think for now how servers give the data
Our role is to get that data fromservers

<@U8BJDBYDR> has joined the channel

So AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript + XML

The "asynchronous" word, means that the response of the server while be processed when available, without to wait and to freeze the display of the page.

Everything clear till now and why we need AJAX calls?

We will be studying AJAX calls in jQuery as they are simpler to implement and the code is also way clearer

This is a basic code in jQuery for AJAX calls

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8GNFLUET/basic_jquery.js|basic jquery>

Explaining each terms
type is the method

We need to get data from the server, right?

So we use `GET` request

If we want to post data to the server, we use `POST` request

If we want to delete a data from the server we use `DELETE` request

If we want to update the data, we use `PUT` request

Clear?

So the difference between GET and POST isn't just about posting/getting the data

It is much more

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions

GET requests should be used only to retrieve data

===========================================================
POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

any doubts?

Usually the length restriction is 8KBs
But that can be modified

any doubts?
Feel free to ask

Should I go ahead?

Okay
So coming back to url...the url is where we are making the request(POST,GET.....)

success is the callback function.

Lets get into examples
May I know which OS you are using?

windows

Okay....create a folder
And create a text file named `test.txt`

Linux Mint

text file in the folder

Okay....create a folder
And create a text file named `test.txt`
text file in the folder

Done?

Great add this content into that file.
&lt;div class=""&gt;This is a very basic example..Cool things coming on their way&lt;/div&gt;

Done?

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8F58S1H7/ajax_basics.html|AJAX basics>

Add this file into same folder

Done?

Open the file .html which you made^ in your browser

Done?

?

Any problems?

Mention here.

Guys what happened? <@U8C2UBX1D> <@U8C3DD53R> <@U8BJDBYDR> <@U8B647JVB>

its not retrieving data from the text file

same here.

Yes cool
Open the console see the error

and paste it here

<@U8C2UBX1D> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C2UBX1D/F8FQQAB0D/image.png|image.png>

index.html:9 Failed to load file:///media/akshay/Volume%20E/exp/ajax/test.txt: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.

It was intentional so don't worry

failed to load test.txt

<@U8B6V28G1> has joined the channel

So a point to note here is that 
AJAX calls are allowed only over HTTP/HTTPS protocols

So I had mentioned on the group to install web server for chrome
It helps us set up a simple server for static files

So now open Web Server for Chrome
Choose the folder which you made

And click on the URL mentioned

done

did the file content load?

yup

Great

Got the concept?

kind of

For Linux users, you can set up server using
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`

Okay
What isn't clear?

Go to that particular directory

and then type the command in that directory using terminal

Is it done for you <@U8C3DD53R>?

its clear but will require some getting used to

Done Thank You!

Yea okay.

Cool

So this was very simple example of AJAX call

We now see some really cool applications :stuck_out_tongue:

We'll be making requests to cross platform
That is we will retrieve data from some website

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8F148P16/-.html|Untitled>

Try this code 
We have made a GET request to `<https://api.meetup.com/2/cities>`
We will get the data from their servers and we will be showing on our webpage

Please close the element with "
`$('.try').text("data.results[0].city");`

Working?

you forgot a " :sweat_smile:

Yea, sorry

yup working:+1:

What about <@U8C3DD53R>?

Working Now, loading...

Is only loading shown?

Or even some data?

So this is how we make requests to other servers and get data.

is the data some huge garbage?

No no

Wait I'll explain that

No Data is shown.

Note that the data is usually returned in `json` formats

Umm
Open console see the error

Post it here

"results":[{"zip":"meetup2","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India","distance":0.46609883797936297,"city":"Delhi","lon":77.2 and so on  was the data right?

Yes

ok:+1:

Data isn't a garabage :stuck_out_tongue:
That is how data is stored in databases,
We can style the data and display it properly on our website

For example this is the list of meetups happening
so we can use those particular parameters, and show on our webpage

Is everything clear?

Let's take an example of WikiPedia API to display the content properly.
So you'll come to know that data is not a garbage :stuck_out_tongue:

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8GGLGSG6/wikipedia_api.html|Wikipedia API>

Try running this

Tell me the output

Data about NITK

Yes, so explaining the parameters sent in url

yup but how did it get formatted?

Formatted?

You mean not displaying the tables and all?

yea...

That's what you have to do using CSS

This is how you get the data

its in a different format to both the page and the format of the last file

Meaning?

i mean its not like the official page of nitk on wikipedia and not like the "garbage" of the last file either, how come?

See the data is same here and on Wikipedia?
Yes?

yup

Okay
Open the console and see that the format of the data is smae

yup

Yes so here we got the data only of NITK
So it is a bit clear
Imagine if we had a lot of queries like last time(all meetups in India)
The content would have looked in a similar manner

ohok

Yea so the data is returned in similar manner
How we display is important

ohok but how is the display different here ?

Yea beacause we took only
`var markup = data.parse.text["*"];`

ohok

In the JSON returned
We took omly the data which we needed
i.e data.parse/text["*"]

See the data returned and how we have accesed the JSON data

ok

Clear?

yup

Cool

So coming back
These were a few open APIs, they don't need authentication
Some need authentication to access their data, like Facebook,Google

They charge if you send more then a certain amount of requests to their server :smirk:

Yes so clear about how to do AJAX calls

?

In the request we sent
dataType is what you're expecting back from the server: json, html, text, etc. jQuery will use this to figure out how to populate the success function's parameter.

If you're posting something like:
`{"name":"John Doe"}`
and expecting back:
`{"success":true}`
Then you should have:

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8F16LF96/-.js|Untitled>

If you're expecting the following:
`&lt;div&gt;Great!&lt;/div&gt;`
Then you should do:

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8FJD6C9Z/-.js|Untitled>

See the difference in callback

Got it?

Great!
I haven't covered about POST request, should I just tell you a small info about how to do that&gt;

Suppose you want to post this data 
`var data = {"name":"John", "age": 34}`

<@U8B6NRYES> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8B6NRYES/F8FLKPG8J/post_request.js|POST request>

Not much a difference, just that type:"POST"

If we haven't mentioned about the type, it takes `GET` request by default

So that was all from my side
I have some more examples but I guess this much is enough for the day

Thank you <@U8C3DD53R> <@U8C2UBX1D> for attending the session

I hope you got some knowledge about AJAX calls and jQuery

Any doubts ask me , right now!

It's great to see such an enthusiasm from you people, keep it up!
And dive deeper, there is yet to learn about server side(backend)
You can always contact any of the mentors for any kind of help.

Also try building something on your own using what all we have taught.
Then go into backend

If you need any help contact me! :smile:

This mentorship isn't over yet, there will be a few more sessions :stuck_out_tongue:

Cool

Bye

Bye! thanks for both the sessions!: +1:
