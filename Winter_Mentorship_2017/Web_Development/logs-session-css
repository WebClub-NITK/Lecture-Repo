Okay so lets start

In today's session we will cover : 
1)Introduction to CSS and syntax
2) Colours 
3) Navigation bar 
4) Inheritance

So what is CSS ? Does anyone have an idea ?

Cascading stylesheets

yeah correct

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. It adds colour , font , shadow etc  and  modifies its visual appearence.

You can use css in three ways in a file
1)One is by including a .css file with the HTML document o using &lt;style&gt; tag in the HTML document itself or inline styling.

or *

In huge websites , it is always preferred to use a separate css file because it helps in managing files better and is considered a good practice

However here for demonstration I will mostly be using the &lt;style &gt; tag

When you use a separate css file , you save that file with a .css extension and the content of that file is the same as the &lt;style&gt; tag except that you dont explicitly use &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; tags

Now lets move to the syntax of css

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8DDXT4KH/selector.gif|selector.gif>

The syntax is basically composed of selector and a declaration block

the selector is the element you wish to style , and the declaration block consists of the property followed by its value separated by a colon

Is everyone clear with this ?

That means all h1 tags will have same style?


Yes in this example

Now lets see an example

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CG2PQPP/-.css|Untitled>

Cool. can we have different styles for different h1s?

Here p refers to &lt;p&gt; element and all the elements having this tag now have a font color red and is centre aligned..
Sometimes you would want to apply a change only to some elements having the tag and not all of them . So here you can use the id or class selector.

Yes
We can do that by giving different id's or classes

Let me descibe the class selector.

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8DDY8DCP/-.css|Untitled>

Here the element would be described as &lt;p class=”para1” &gt;

The id selector would also serve the same purpose but there is a big difference between them

The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

So if the same element was to have a ID selector , &lt;p id="paraid"&gt;

And when you want to refer this element by its ID then we say

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8C9P0TDZ/-.css|Untitled>

Now we will look at an example and add color , fonts etc to it . So please open your text editors and copy this code

Save it with .html extension

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8DDYKKNK/-.html|Untitled>

Whats the difference between .para1 and #para1?

So lets proceed any doubts ?

# para1 is when an element is referred by is

.para1 is for classes
#para1 for id

ID *

Okay so first lets add colour to the paragraph text

With CSS, a color is most often specified by:
a valid color name - like "red" 
a HEX value - like "#ff0000" 
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

Now in that same HTML document add a style tag

As you guys know each tag has its opening and closing complimentary tags

Without # or . is for the in-built tags?

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CD35CH2/Untitled.html|Untitled>

Your document should look like this

Sorry my bad its .para1{}

Please make that change

Is everyone with me?

Not-necessarily in-built
You can define your own tags, and giving the styling without . or #

Nothing happen

Each colour has a different hex value(#rrggbb) and different values for r,g,b and this can be found through a color chart.

So here i m using the rgb format with the color attribute

change the quotes to "

And why do we have a link to my.html?

In the sample code...

Where?

class="para1"

the quotation marks are a little different

thanx

Okayy so now you can also set the background colour of a document

You can also have a background color or  image and this is specifies in the body tag.

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8DDZE1PH/-.html|Untitled>

add this under your style tag

Is everyone with me ?

Now one thing , there are a lot of colours but everything cannot be specified by just typing the colour name , so be careful with that

Similarly background image can be applied by :- 
 background-image: url("hello.gif");

this comes under the body tag too

but make sure you have the image downloaded and specify its path in the url

Now lets move on to padding

The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). When we say padding : 20px. This applies padding in top bottom right and left direction . You can individually do it just for the top as well like :- padding-top=20px;

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8BS4SWGZ/-.html|Untitled>

Add this code within your .para1 tag and see the difference

What do you observe?

Tab space

Of 20px

yeah , padding is a very commonly used attribute while working with website and its a quick hack to a lot of problems which you might face :stuck_out_tongue:

text moved to 20 px

Yeah

So now we will see height and width attributes

As the name suggests the height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8D82DW6A/-.css|Untitled>

Now lets say I have an image element and I explicitly want to specify it height

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8BS5HPL1/-.html|Untitled>

Your code would look something like this

Specify the path of the image in the src attribute

Is everyone clear with this ?

<@U8BBB0VD0> commented on <@U8AAM6VLJ>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CD35CH2/Untitled.html|Untitled>: why this problem occurred ?

What is the difference between px and % ?

<@U8C9NATL3> commented on <@U8AAM6VLJ>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CD35CH2/Untitled.html|Untitled>: try changing " in code.

Please change the quotations to " "  in the class para1 and in case you guys are getting an error

Also i forgot to mention one more thing ,

- Pixels (px) are browser dependent. It is the absolute size that you would see on your screen.
- % referrs to the base text size.

You can also have background gradients instead of just plain colour

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8D8379JA/-.html|Untitled>

<@U8BBB0VD0> commented on <@U8AAM6VLJ>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CD35CH2/Untitled.html|Untitled>: ya I got that..... but what's the diff?

padding: 20%;
Pushes the text down too?

Why title is displayed with tags?

It does in all 4 directions

padding?

<@U89QYNMUH> commented on <@U8AAM6VLJ>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CD35CH2/Untitled.html|Untitled>: the quotations are a bit different... even tiny differences matter in programming :wink:

Yes

Now lets look at Pseudo Classes

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
Style an element when a user mouses over it 
Style visited and unvisited links differently

** Please the change the quotations of my.html to " " **

Just a second
Sorry for interrupting <@U8AAM6VLJ>

Yeah

Please note `padding:20px;`
If it is mentioned in box, in all the directions, 20px space will be seen (upper,lower,left,right)

Difference between px and %
- Pixels (px) are browser dependent. It is the absolute size that you would see on your screen.
- % referrs to the base text size.

Continue <@U8AAM6VLJ>

Why do we have a link to my.html?

So lets look at the anchor tag first

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CG69Z0V/Untitled.html|Untitled>

add some text within the &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt; tags

Now href is basically used to provide a link to the page which is opened on a mouse click

we are going to see visited, unvisited properties

It can be another Html document or a website

doesnt make a difference, you can ignore

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8BN0QSP2/-.html|Untitled>

<@U8AAM6VLJ> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8AAM6VLJ/F8CBZ27K4/-.css|Untitled>

And add this under the style tag

So in pseudo class we define multiple states of an element in different scenarios

its syntax is element:property{

so here link , visited and hover are different states of the link

Are you all following this ?

i mean ignore the &lt;h1&gt; tag

Notice the changes after you add this css

Explain use of each plz.

Yeah

so hover is basically used to define properties when you just move the mouse over the link without clicking it

visited is used to define properties after the link has been clicked on

and link is used to define the initial property of the anchor link

You would have seen the link colour change to purple when you click on a link after googling something

once visited ,hover doesn't work right?

They use the visited property to do so

Now Sharanya will continue with Nav Bars and Inheritance

Hover will still work

Hi

So now that you got to know the syntax of various attributes, we'll use them to make a basic navigation bar

its stops changing color once i have visited even if i hover over it..

Having easy-to-use navigation is important for any web site.
A navigation bar needs standard HTML as a base.

I'm going to put up the code for a simple nav bar... execute it and give a thumbs up when you are done

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8DE3C1TR/-.html|Untitled>

Have you used the css for each of the anchor tags in the same order as I showed because  a:hover must come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective

ok that's the mistake, thanks

You may be remembering the meta tags from last session, so i wont be explaining that

see the html part of the code

We are making the nav bar using a list... so there's the html code for that

And we are styling the list using css

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CC13DT4/-.css|Untitled> and commented: This prevents the list from having any bullets or anything

You can try deleting this line from the code, what happens?

People reply
A question is asked

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CC1FTCJ/-.css|Untitled> and commented: We add this because we dont want any space between the nav bar and the screen

I see bullets!

good!

same

Hey!!!

<@U8BBB0VD0> commented on <@U89QYNMUH>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CC1FTCJ/-.css|Untitled>: what is default padding ?

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8BN3K1KJ/-.css|Untitled> and commented: Overflow property is used to control what happens to stuff that overflows the element box.

you can try deleting this line to see what happens

I didn't understand!

<@U89QYNMUH> commented on <@U89QYNMUH>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CC1FTCJ/-.css|Untitled>: It depends on the browser.. we added this line just to be safe

only bullets are visible

blank screen!!

blank screen

but why?

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8BN46656/-.css|Untitled> and commented: To shift the whole list to the left

It is'nt a blank screen

Select the text, you'll come to know there is text there

then?

try adding background-color: #333; to li a {}

:+1:

It should technically make no difference

Do you understand the overflow:hidden property?

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CDAFBB6/-.css|Untitled> and commented: You can set the display style as inline, block, flex and many more...

no

<https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp>

See whenever the text is more then the size of the block, the rest of the content will be hidden

Is everyone with me ?

We don't want text overflow, that is the basic of it

Understood?

:sweat_smile: no

Okay.. what did you not understand?

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CDARSR2/-.css|Untitled> and commented: Remember this: padding values go as top, right, bottom, left

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
div {
    background-color: #eee;
    width: 200px;
    height: 50px;
    border: 1px dotted black;
    overflow: hidden;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CSS Overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

Run this code in a different file

See the difference 
when you set `overflow: visible;` instead of `overflow: hidden`

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8D88RB5L/-.css|Untitled> and commented: This is because we dont want any unline for our links... try removing this and see

Got yeah?

<@U8B7P03QD> commented on <@U89QYNMUH>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8D88RB5L/-.css|Untitled>: links got underlined

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8BSBTXQR/-.css|Untitled> and commented: 'active' is used to change the styles when the element is active i.e when you click on it

<@U8B6NRYES> commented on <@U89QYNMUH>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8D88RB5L/-.css|Untitled>: Yes correct

So any doubts in this nav bar?

qverflow hidden does not allow the content to flow out of a box?

Yes

I hope now you can create your own pretty nav bars :stuck_out_tongue:

It basically hides the content
The content will still be there

what decides the box parameters?

Why is text starts aligning one after another down the line, when float : center?

Means?

I did not understand your doubt

Now I'll quickly cover a concept called Inheritance

what's the box size? browser dependent?:sweat_smile:

Because in that line, you chose to keep it in center
So it takes the center of the browser

By default it is like that.

It can take only 4 values

left,right,none,inherit

A rule that has the !important property will always be applied no matter where that rule appears in the CSS document.

No no

oops sorry ignore that

We gave the box size in the `&lt;div&gt;` tag

See carefully

Oh! So, when I give center, it doesn't understand and simply does it's normal job?

The inherit keyword specifies that a property should inherit its value from its parent element

got it!!

yup.

Yes

Cool

Try keepin it to right also once

See the difference

I did. Thanks

<@U89QYNMUH> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U89QYNMUH/F8CDC71NY/-.html|Untitled> and commented: Try this code

What do you understand from this?

......Anyone ?

The second span element 'inherited' the green color from its parent element &lt;div&gt;... Can you see it now?

different divisions get different colors,span responds according to its default except when it acts as a part of its parent class

yes very good

Span always have blue text color?

no we are setting the blue color

see the css part of span

Oh! My bad. Thanks

```
span {
    color: blue;
    border: 1px solid black;
}
.extra span {
    color: inherit;
}
```

Hmm...k

All span have prop's of first one except child of extra class.

where color attribute is overwritten

So we have covered inheritance

so, inherited from claas:extra, correct?

Oh! Thanks

yup.

<@U8BBB0VD0> yeah

I'll just put up a code for making an image gallery... Ask doubts where you dont understand.
