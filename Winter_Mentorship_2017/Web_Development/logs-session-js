Let us start.

So u guys learn html and css in the previous session.

This is enough to built a basic stylised static web page

But to create dynamic websites with interactive features u need js.

JavaScript is an scripting language that is primarily used for creating interactive features on webpages. It can be used to create menus, validate forms, swap images, or just about anything else you can think of to do on a webpage.

Javascipt is completely different from Java.

Java is a compiled language. This means that the Java code must be transformed ("compiled") into a high-level programming language before it can run.

JavaScript is an interpreted language. It doesn't need to be compiled before it is run. In an interpreted language the instructions are parsed (divided into small components that can be analyzed). For instance, as the browser "reads" this page, it breaks down each of the page's components into individual components and interprets each component as it moves down the page

Now to include javascript in ur html code.

Like CSS, u can include it in 2 ways

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8D9K5YE7/Include_JS.html|Include JS>

Here text/javascript is optional as all browsers now always choose js as default programming language

It is a good practice to write js code in separate file as

You can use same code and functions in different html files.

It makes ur page faster as the browser can cache ur js files to be used by the different pages

Any doubts..?

didnt exactly get the code written is it default syntax or?

Moving on.

I am coming there.

JS is a weakly typed language.

Compared to ur other languages like cpp, java where u need to specify datatypes of the variables separately

What does it mean?

In JS all variables are declared using `var`

Also ; is optional, but is recommended that u use ; in ur code.

`var x=5;var a="Hello";`

Please open up your browsers.

Means you don't have to declare the different data type for different variable like for integer string etc

Right click and click on Inspect element

They are related to each other in a way car and carpet are related to each other.

And goto console

Done..?

All variables are declared with same data type in JavaScript which is "var"

Just like your basic printf and cout to print in std out.

Here u use console

So 
`console.log("Hey");`

`alert('hmm')`

Try these two commands.

Hopefully, everyone got a dialogbox for alert

So we will use these 2 output ways to see other features.

I'll move on to objects.

Basically object is just a collection of properties and methods.

in the console no?

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8CQ8LARE/object.html|Object>

yes type in console

Copy paste in ur console.

u can access object properties like 
`person.age` or `person['age']`

Any doubts so far..?

What does the above code do? I am getting 'undefined'

type person.age

youll get 50

Oh! Thanks

So, javasicript objects are mutable

i.e When u make a copy of ur object and make changes there

it changes original object as well.

hey wait i am also getting undefined

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8CQB5F2L/Object_mutable.js|Object mutable>

where to type age

??

Try console.log(person)

after the snippet

Everybody done..?

So, other things like conditional statements, loops, strings are pretty much same here in js.

what exactly does it do?

I wont be focussing much on that.

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8EGHA4UF/Conditional.html|Conditional>

var person = {
    firstName : "John",
    lastName  : "Doe",
    age       : 50,
    eyeColor  : "blue"
};

this one

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DCA9ZKM/loop.html|loop>

it shows that variable(object) person is assigned this values

You can try out these html files later.

even after assigning it says undefined

Moving to arrays. 
As no separate datatypes in js, array can hold a bunch of different kind of data together.

KK...hmmm

Hmm kkk

Unlike cpp ,java where all the members of array must be of the same type

What is the <@U8C55GJ5D> Skipping topics?

even after doing console.log(person) ?

*this

`var arr = [1,2,3]`

For trying out some array examples,

`document.getElementById('id')`

This is used to select an HTML element in js.

<@U8BNR3DME> will be talking more about this later

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8E123F7E/array.html|Array>

Run this HTML snippet.

So basically here we are declaring a basic array.

Then selecting an html para tag by its id and dynamically changing its HTML content.

Done..?

what output should we get?

Let us see some array methods.

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8ERFBCSJ/basic_array_functions.html|Basic array functions>

So some basic functions here.

<@U8CN67YES> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8E123F7E/array.html|Array>: where are you printing the elements of array??

`var x = arr.pop()`

so an array works like  a stack in js?

Load it in ur browser. You can see the elements of the array n ur browser.

yes <@U8C2UBX1D>

Any other doubts.?

Please ask if you have any doubts.
<@U8BNR3DME> will continue.

what is object?

so basically a normal variable can store a single value be it of any type int,string etc.

yeah but object can store others also

i got that but i was asking in that snippet

among 40,hey,100,1,5,25,10
which one is a object?

you are confused with what is that *Object* getting printed?

{name:"kk",job:"hmm"} &lt;- this was object

ok ok yeah i got it that was a object
sorry my bad ..

cool

Okay so, 
javascript can be used to create dynamic HTML
With the help of javascript you can do the following things:
1. Change HTML elements of the page, also their attributes
2. Change CSS styles 
3. Add, remove HTML elements
and much more...

So how can you access the elements of the web page via javascript?

This is where HTML DOM comes into picture!

DOM stands for Document Object Model 
HTML DOM is a API which treats HTML as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the html document

I will give a example to make this statement clear...

So consider this HTML code

<@U8BNR3DME> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8BNR3DME/F8E2YLZ1A/html_dom.html|HTML DOM>

So when you open this html file in your browser,
 After the webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page

<@U8BNR3DME> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8BNR3DME/F8E306VGC/dom.png|dom.png>

so the entire page is available to JS, from the document object

In the example above each node of the tree is a object

Any doubt so far?

doubts*

Alright now moving on to writing js code to access and modify elements of the page,
This is called as DOM manipulation.

Okay so many functions are available in javascript for manipulating DOM
I will be going over some of them here

A simple one is getElementById(id)

Take a look at this code

<@U8BNR3DME> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8BNR3DME/F8E68HXJ9/dom_manipulation.html|DOM manipulation>

So in the javascript code 
document.getElementById() finds the HTML element with the id "p1" in the DOM tree,

So JavaScript is enough for developing websites?

HTML,css and js on its own is enough to make a dynamic front end.

Is it necessary to keep every id needed in &lt;script&gt; before it?

Text for p1 is stored in innerHtml variable in object of p1
Thus setting .innerHTML to a new string on the HTML element p1 allows us to modify it

Nope.

We can only change the inner html but not add html through js?

```
&lt;script&gt;
	document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = "New text!";
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p id="p1"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;

```

But its not working!

This will work just fine

No scripts can be written anywhere in the html file or by making a new file and including it

We can.

No, Its still not working.

Cool. Thanks

Another example for modifying css in a webpage

<@U8BNR3DME> uploaded a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8BNR3DME/F8E24U20J/css_manipulation.html|CSS manipulation>

yea its not working

Any doubts so far??

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id="div1"&gt;
&lt;p id="p1"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2"&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var para = document.createElement("p");
var node = document.createTextNode("This is new.");
para.appendChild(node);
var element = document.getElementById("div1");
element.appendChild(para);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

yea it shouldn't work
Because only 1(first) element is returned in getElementById

Thanks

Please respond.

Heyy...

Hi.

LOL

There are many more functions available,
Take a look at this later
<https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp>

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction>

Now <@U8C55GJ5D> will continue further

Let us move on HTML events.

Events are things or 'triggers' which a browser does or a user does

Thanks

what does this code do?

So to make changes to more then one element we use getElementsByClassName

e.g.
&gt; A button click by a user
&gt; Changing text in input text field
&gt; Pressing enter key.
&gt; When a browser finishes loading an html page

We can carry out operations with these events.

This is called event handling

` &lt;element event="some JavaScript"&gt;`

For example if we want an alert box onclick on a button

`&lt;button onclick="alert('hey')"&gt;btn&lt;/button&gt;`

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>

Try out this snippet.

Here on clicking the button with id myBtn , it selects the dom element with the id and changes the html content.

Often what we require may need more than 1 line of js code.

So more commonly we see these  events calling js functions

Is onlick inline script?

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8ERVTC86/Event_with_function.html|Event with function>

Try out this snippet. Is it working..?

no no
onclick is an event

So here we see that we use the same function for two buttons

HOW IS IT TELLING THE TIME??

We pass the color to custom function where it finds the DOM elemeny with id para

then we change the attribute of that element

Any doubts..?

go to console in your browser
type `Date()`

What is the use of var par = document.getElementById("para");
?

<@U8CN67YES> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>: how is this telling the time??

I mean, why are we using a new variable?

<@U8ATV8M3M> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>: Date(); is a function, which returns date and time

Though here we do not require to store the DOM element in a variable

it is a good practice to store if u r accessing the same element many times

The variables can be cached in the browser

<@U8CN67YES> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>: does this access the time online ?

So it is more efficient

Oh! Okay. Cool.

Finding in DOM tree takes time

Go Date is a function in JS , which gives current date and time

<@U8C55GJ5D> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>: No. through ur browser

but we havent used par anywhere right?

nope

<@U8BNR3DME> commented on <@U8C55GJ5D>’s file <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DTGK1QT/event_basic.html|Event basic>: When setting a date, without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone.

In this case no. But, if we need to access #para a lot of times. It will be helpful.

Some other commonly used events are
```onchange     An HTML element has been changed
onclick     The user clicks an HTML element
onmouseover     The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
onmouseout     The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
onkeydown     The user pushes a keyboard key
onload     The browser has finished loading the page```

ok..

onchange is mostly used with text boxes, e.g when you are making a searchbar

After every character change u need to update the results

so that event can be used there.

So,
So
Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
&gt;  Things that should be done every time a page loads
&gt;  Things that should be done when the page is closed
&gt;   Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
&gt;   Content that should be verified when a user inputs data

any doubts..?

If someone orders a steak, and I order water, it makes sense if my order comes fast.

You can try changing para.style.color to par.style.color.

More often than not when u send request to server through javascript

it will take time to process and send a response

While in some requests u may need some bulky files, some others might need just some text

Asynchronous means code (generally) wont block the next line of code from executing if it takes a while.

An example will make it clear.
The setTimeout function is probably the simplest way to asynchronously schedule code to run in the future.

`setTimeout(&lt;function to run&gt;, &lt;delay time before running in millisecond&gt;)`

```setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}, 2000);```

In this example Goodbye will be printed after 2 seconds.

Is it clear?

Not really, what exactly is function?

So this is part of callback functions in javascript

Ok...

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DF0ENF3/setTimeout_basic_example.js|setTimeout basic example>

If u run some code like this, what output do u expect?

setTimeout is a asynchrounous function which will get executed and then it execution of the next line of js code will take place

After 2 seconds that is 2000 milliseconds

Ok so function() here is what, exactly?

Hello. Hello again!, Goodbye!

Right?

setTimeOut takes two parameters

The callback function which would get executed after 2 sec

first one is another function

It tells that execute that function after a certain interval of time

Could you help out with an example?:sweat_smile:

Yes.

It prints hello

Ok so that is just any function like custom we had last.

yes.

Then when it encounters setTimeout execution carries forward.

setTimeout ( &lt;the function to execute after&gt; , &lt;this is time has passed&gt;)

&lt;this much time has passed&gt;*

It separately u can say 'remembers' that I have to wait two seconds before running the function passed in setTimeout(without a name called anonymous functions)

So we see that it does not block the execution.

But u should be careful while using this as this can cause unexpected behaviour.

<@U8C55GJ5D> shared a file: <https://wintermentorshipweb.slack.com/files/U8C55GJ5D/F8DF25G3B/Unexpected_asynchronous.js|Unexpected asynchronous>

This will be the last example for today.

Go through this snippet and think what will be the output . Then run and see if u get the same output.

This will be all for today's session.

Ask if u have any doubts..

I did not understand what happened in the last code.

Nothing was printed on the console?

its giving some random output and then 4 seconds elapsed

4 seconds elapsed is not printed..?

yes.

By the time ur control comes back to the function passed in the setTimeout, the loop has already finished running.

So i becomes 4.

what about the random output?

What output are u getting..?

i run it twice got 2315 and then 2341

Oh sorry. have changed the snippet now.

Run again

3087 and then 4 second(s) elapsed

running on firefox..?

chrome

that is some debugging code printed by the browser

ohok

It should print 4 secs elapsed 3 times

no, just once

There is a circled 3 on the left of output right?

That means repeated 3 times.

ohok

yea checked it. if u run through console it prints some debugging code.

cool, thanks.

I had a question, lets say that we used setTimeOut() and then introduced a loop, our timer is such that it finishes mid way through the loop so which happens next rest of the loop or function()
